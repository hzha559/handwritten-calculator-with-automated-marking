A GUI of handwritten-calculator-with-automated-marking function.

I made this project because I think it will make the life easier for the young kids to practice their calculation skills.

Written with Pytorch and the network is Resnet-18, the validation accuracy is 97%.

It is ready-to-use (You need to install some libraries of course).

Please refer to the install instructions.
